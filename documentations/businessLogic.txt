This note is to clear sequences of ◊ 'CODING SEQUENCE LOGIC' ◊
Business and coding layers....
------------------------------------

Think of it like a request traveling through your app:

Request → Route → Middleware → Controller → Database → Response

*** So you code in REVERSE order of the request flow:

Database (Model) → Controller → Middleware → Route → Server

---------
Got it! I'll follow this order from now on:

1. Business Logic      → controller, model, routes (make it work first)
2. Middleware          → hashPassword, validation (process the data)
3. Security           → JWT, protect routes (lock it down)

---------
So the pattern will always be:
make it work → make it clean → make it secure
-----------

Always follow this sequence:
1. Model        → define the data shape (schema)
2. Controller   → write the business logic
3. Middleware   → process / protect the request
4. Routes       → connect everything together
5. Server.js    → register the routes

Why this order?

Model - first because controller depends on it
Controller - second because middleware depends on knowing what it's protecting
Middleware - after because it wraps around the controller
Routes - last because it connects everything that's already built
